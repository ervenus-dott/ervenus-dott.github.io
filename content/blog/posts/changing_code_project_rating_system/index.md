title: Changing the Rating System used for coding projects

I've decided to change how the posts in the code projects are rated. I've never liked being scored so linearly. I feel like that really flattens any and all personal expression when it comes to looking back and reviewing something I've worked on. So I've decided to have a little more fun with it to make it a few word subjective rating that allows for more interpretabilityðŸŒˆ
