This was one of the artworks I made that has just been an impromput moment of wanting to make a like multi-drawing composition. A lot of times I feel like its not worth making because I convince myself I cant execute my ideas clearly enough to make it worth it. Which I think typing this now is interesting looking back on it because I feel more comfortable with it retroactively. I think it's kind of neat.
